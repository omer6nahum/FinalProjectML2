# Machine Learning II Final Project - English Premier League Table Prediction

*The English Premier League* is the top level of the English football league system. 
Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (the second level of the English football league system). 
Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away). 
Each team earns 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss. 
The final season league table is induced by the cumulative number of points for each team.

The project goal is to suggest and evaluate several ML approaches for predicting the final English Premier League table based on data regarding the contested teams squads and season matches. 
This task is highly important for various organizations, including football clubs, media channels, gambling agencies, etc.
